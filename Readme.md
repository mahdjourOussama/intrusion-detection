# Intrusion Detection Project

## 📘 **Project Description**

This is a research project that I used as my end of studies project to obtain a state engineer degree in Information Systems from the National Polytechnic School of Oran, Algeria. The goal of this project is to find a new approach to enhance intrusion detection using both machine learning and deep learning techniques.
